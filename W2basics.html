    <h2>variables</h2>
    
    <script>
        // script tag means that it'll be javascript between
        /* this is a multi line note

        you have to manually end it */
        // Let's create a variable with a defalt value
        // var means that you want to create a variable
        var firstName = "Boone";

    <h2>functions</h2>

    <script>
        // let's create a function
        // functions allow you to reuse code
        // functions are awesome; use them as much as possible
        // To create a function, use the JavaScript keyword function
        //  Then come up with a 'descriptive' function name
        // there will be () 
        // The function code lives between {}
        function runCalc(){
            // create 2 variables to hold numbers that the user gives me
            var num1 = 0;
            var num2 = 0;

            // let's gather a number from the user

                console.log(num1)
                console.log(num2)
            //what does parseInt mean?
            // because JavaScript is loosely/dynamically typed, cast the imputs as numbers
            var sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2);
            alert("the sum is: " + sum);


            // return the sum of num1 + num2

    <h2>decision logic</h2>

        if (age == 5) { // double == is the check equality - are the values the same?
            console.log("age is 5");
        }

            console.log("age is not 5");
        }

        // check multiple conditions
        if (age == 6){ // you can only have 1 if statement in a block of decision logic
            console.log("age is 6");
        }
        else if(age == 12){ // you can have many else if statements
            console.log("age is 12");
        }
        // if age is 12 or 16 then this would be true
        else if(age == 15 || age == 16){ // you can have many else if statements
            console.log("age is 15 or 16");
        }
